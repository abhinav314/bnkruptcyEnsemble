# Predictive Model to Classify the Bankruptcy Status of a Firm

This project is for MGMT 590 - Data Mining at Krannert School of Management, developed by Abhinav Chanda, Pranay Khandelwal and Tirthankar Mukhopadhyay.

The objective of the project was to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric measures to foresee a financial condition (bankrupt or not) of a firm based on a financial balance sheet data set available on Kaggle.

We used multiple algorithms to generate accurate predictions and found out that a hyper-parameter tuned xGBoost algorithm blended with bagging algorithms (Random Forests) and generalized linear models (logistic and ridge regression) gave the most robust results.
